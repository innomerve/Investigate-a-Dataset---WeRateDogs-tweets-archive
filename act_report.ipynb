Using the `describe` function, I got information about the score series such as its minimum value, its maximum value, its average and the value of its quantiles. I considered that the best rated tweet dogs are those with a rate higher than the 3rd quantile of the series. **Thus, 736 tweets of dogs were noted as the best.** \n"
